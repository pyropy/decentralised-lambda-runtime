# Decentralised Lambda Runtime

Goal of this project is to provide runtime framework for writing lambda like functions 
that can be compiled to WASM and executed on a decentralised network.

This is an early prototype and is currently only adapted to run on the Bacalhau network. 
In the future other network may be supported as well.

To invoke functions check out the [decentralised-lambda-node](https://github.com/pyropy/decentralised-lambda-node) project.
